# grief-ops-suite
Grief Ops Suite is a modular grief survival platform that adapts to the user’s current operational state and deploys the right mode for the moment. It’s not “self-care.” It’s not “healing.” It’s not “journal your feelings and manifest peace.” It’s a command center built for what grief actually does to a person.
